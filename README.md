# CargoPath Harmony Plugin

CargoPath is a simple Harmony plugin designed to load embedded `cargopath` data. It works similarly to the RustEdit extension but should **not** be used in conjunction with it to avoid conflicts.

## Features

- **Embedded CargoPath Data Loading**: Seamlessly loads embedded `cargopath` data.
- **RustEdit Extension Alternative**: Provides similar functionality without requiring the RustEdit extension.
- **Harmony Integration**: Built as a Harmony plugin for straightforward integration with compatible systems.

## Installation

1. **Download the Harmony DLL**:
   - Locate the Harmony DLL in the `CargoPath/bin/Release` directory of this repository.

2. **Move the DLL to the HarmonyMods Folder**:
   - Copy the Harmony DLL to your `HarmonyMods` folder.

## Usage

1. Ensure the plugin is placed in the `HarmonyMods` folder.
2. Start your server.
3. The plugin will automatically load embedded `cargopath` data.

## Compatibility

- Do **not** use this plugin alongside the RustEdit extension as they serve similar purposes and may cause conflicts.
